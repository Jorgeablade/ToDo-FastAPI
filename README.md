## üßê Why? <a name = "about"></a>

This is just a super tiny project to try to get more knowledge about FastAPI, and because is for a school project, so, yeah super funny

Since it's not finished, there are some useless code commented.

## üèÅ How to clone it and run it <a name = "getting_started"></a>

 Clone the repository where you are gonna work
    
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Jorgeablade/ToDo-FastAPI.git
```

Create or activate the venv. In case you wanna create a new venv, just delete the one you cloned and create a new one.
But if you are keeping this one, run:
    
```bash
 ./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # If you are in Windows
 source ./.venv/Scripts/activate # If Linux distribution
```

Create a random key using random_key.py. This will create a .env with SECRET=blablablablablabla :)

```bash
 ./random_key.py
``` 
    
 And run the project
    
```bash
 uvicorn app:app --reload 
```
